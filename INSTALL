1. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

  MRNet is designed to be a highly-portable system. It should build
  effortlessly with recent GNU compilers, as well as native compilers on
  Solaris, AIX, and Windows. See the README for the latest list of
  platforms on which we have built and successfully tested MRNet.

2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

  The third party tools that MRNet uses and needs for proper installation are: 
    - GNU make

3. Build Configuration

  MRNet uses GNU autoconf to discover the platform specific configuration
  parameters. The script that does this auto-configuration is called configure. 

    UNIX>  ./configure --help

  shows all possible options of the command. Below, we display the MRNet-specific
  ones: 

    --with-startup=METHOD       Tree instantiation method - "ssh" (default),
                                                            "cray_xt"

    --with-alpstoolhelp-lib=DIR (CrayXT only) Absolute path to directory containing
				              libalps library
    --with-alpstoolhelp-inc=DIR (CrayXT only) Absolute path to directory containing
                                              libalps.h


  ./configure without any options should give reasonable results, but the user
  may specify certain options. For example, 

    UNIX> ./configure CXX=g++

  instructs the configure script to use g++ for the C++ compiler
 

4. Compilation and Installation

  For this discussion, $MRNET_ROOT is the location of the top-level directory
  of the MRNet distribution and $MRNET_ARCH is a string describing the platform
  (OS and architecture) as discovered by autoconf. For all instructions, it is
  assumed that the current working directory is $MRNET_ROOT.

  * To build the MRNet toolkit: 

    UNIX>  make

    After a successful build, the following files will be present: 
      $MRNET_ROOT/bin/$MRNET_ARCH/mrnet_commnode: MRNet internal communcation node (used internally)
      $MRNET_ROOT/bin/$MRNET_ARCH/mrnet_topgen: MRNet topology file generator
      $MRNET_ROOT/lib/$MRNET_ARCH/libmrnet.[a,so]: MRNet API library
      $MRNET_ROOT/lib/$MRNET_ARCH/libmrnet_lightweight.[a,so]: Lightweight MRNet library
      $MRNET_ROOT/lib/$MRNET_ARCH/libxplat.[a,so]: Cross-Platform library
      $MRNET_ROOT/lib/$MRNET_ARCH/libxplat_lightweight.[a,so]: Lightweight Cross-Platform library
  
  * To build the standard MRNet tests:

    UNIX>  make tests

    After a successful build, the following files will be present: 
      $MRNET_ROOT/bin/$MRNET_ARCH/*_[FE,BE]: MRNet test front-end and back-end programs
      $MRNET_ROOT/bin/$MRNET_ARCH/mrnet_tests.sh: MRNet test driver script

  * To build the MRNet examples:

    UNIX>  make examples

  * To install the MRNet toolkit: 

    UNIX>  make install
    UNIX>  make install-examples (Optional: install example programs)
    UNIX>  make install-tests    (Optional: install test programs)
    UNIX>  make install-boost    (Optional: install boost headers if not present on system)
